# IoT
my notes on Iot hacking/reverse engineering

Will run through Pentester Academy exercises on "[IoT firmware Internals](https://www.attackdefense.com/challengedetails?cid=859)" and get their basics badge+do required exercises.

Also have NoStarch press "Practical IoT hacking" coming too, if the physical hacking side doesnâ€™t appeal so much I may postpone that section of the book and focus on rootkits with another of Vivek's course "[Linux Rootkits](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=38)"
