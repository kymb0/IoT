![Plan of action Slide](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/raw/main/note_dir/images/steps.png)  

Before running through steps: run [packages.sh](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/example_files/packages.sh) > set paths and alias for build (example in [environ.sh](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/example_files/environ.sh))  
#### Step 1 breakdown:  
Build our toolchain (what is a [toolchain?](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/Toolchain.md))  
To do this we must configure crosstool-ng, and then compile it.  
We configure with `ct-ng menuconfig` (An example config is [here](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/ct-ng-config))  
most options in config are self explainatory, the only one that was not (for me) was C library. By defukat this was set to gLibc, we want uClibc - this is because uClibc is more of a "smaller and barebones library"

The actual commands to do the above are as follows, as we can see all we are doing is unpacking the offline install directory as well as changing the base install directory from `/` to `/Step-1/customtoolchain`, build crosstool-ng with `make`, install with `make install`, and then build our custome toolchain using the installed and configured crosstool-ng.  
Once built, we can see our binaries in the specified /bin/ directory - this important for later on.
```
tar xf crosstool-ng-1.23.0.tar.xz
cd crosstool-ng-1.23.0
./configure --prefix=$BASE_INSTALL_DIR/Step-1/customtoolchain
make
make install
cd ..
cp config_file .config
ct-ng build
```
### Step 2 breakdown: 
configure and compile u-boot
The commands are as below, and a breakdown of how we create the config file as well the `arm-make` alias are below
```
tar xf u-boot-2018.01.tar.bz2`  
cd u-boot-2018.01
cp ../u-boot-2018.01 .config
arm-make
```
So above, we decompress u-boot.tar  
Copy the config file across. Why do we need a config file?  
As we are compiling u-boot for a specific device (beagleboneblack) device specific details, as u-boot will be responsible for initializing many devices.
These files are locatated in `configs/` - whcih contains configs files for different processors, boards, etc. The files tell u-boot which support needs to be compiled in aswell as env settings.  
How do we create the config file?  
we can find our particular configs with `ls config/am335x_*`
this will list all relevant files - luckily for us the SoC/board manufacturer will stipulate which configs are to be used, we can gleam this from their website. In this case Texas Instruments site tells us to use `am335x_evm_defconfig` in order to boot beagleboneblack.  

Next we need a copy of the device tree file, we look inside `arch` and figure out the architecture (will be arm), then list the files in dts `ls config/am335x-`, we will choose the dts with the same naming convention as the config file specified by manufacturer, so, `am335x_evm.dts`  

(the dts contains large amounts of info regarding different devices, power profiles, memory locations, etc)

now, compilation process - note `arm make` is an alias for `'ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-uclibcgnueabihf- make'` as set by the environ.sh file. Essentially it sets the architecture to arm and sets the crosscompilation toolchain to the binary installed by our custom toolchain in step 1.  
`arm-make distclean` - clean out settings  
`arm-make am335x_evm_defconfig` - using the alias, this will create a config file for us to use (we can inspect and modify via `arm-make menuconfig`)   What would we want to modify? possibly the CLI, shellprompt, boot-delay, etc. We can also include support for additional commands, filesystem support, etc.

finally after creating our config file, we run `arm-make`, after 5 or so minutes we will see our `MLO` file, aswell as u-boot.img, etc.
