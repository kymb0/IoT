Before running through steps: run [packages.sh](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/example_files/packages.sh) > set paths and alias for build (example in [environ.sh](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/example_files/environ.sh))  
#### Step 1 breakdown:  
Build our toolchain (what is a [toolchain?](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/Toolchain.md))  
To do this we must configure crosstool-ng, and then compile it.  
We configure with `ct-ng menuconfig` (An example config is [here](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/ct-ng-config))  
most options in config are self explainatory, the only one that was not (for me) was C library. By defukat this was set to gLibc, we want uClibc - this is because uClibc is more of a "smaller and barebones library"

The actual commands to do the above are as follows, as we can see all we are doing is unpacking the offline install directory as well as changing the base install directory from `/` to `/Step-1/customtoolchain`, build crosstool-ng with `make`, install with `make install`, and then build our custome toolchain using the installed and configured crosstool-ng.  
Once built, we can see our binaries in the specified /bin/ directory - this important for later on.
```
tar xf crosstool-ng-1.23.0.tar.xz
cd crosstool-ng-1.23.0
./configure --prefix=$BASE_INSTALL_DIR/Step-1/customtoolchain
make
make install
cd ..
cp config_file .config
ct-ng build
```
