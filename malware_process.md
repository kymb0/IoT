install packages.sh > set paths and alias for build (example in [environ.sh](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/boot_loader/build/env.sh))  
 #### Step 1 breakdown:  
  Build our toolchain (what is a [toolchain?](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/Toolchain.md))  
  To do this we must configure crosstool-ng, and then compile it.  
  We configure with `ct-ng menuconfig`. An example config is [here](https://github.com/kymb0/IoT/blob/main/note_dir/ct-ng-config)  
  most options in config are self explainatory, the only one that was not (for me) was C library. By defukat this was set to gLibc, we want uClibc - this is because uClibc is more of a "smaller and barebones library"
